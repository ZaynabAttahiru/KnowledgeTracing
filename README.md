# KnowledgeTracing
A basic implementation of knowledge tracing for L46 paper.

The implementation is entirely based on the PyTorch framework. Script files to allow codebase to run from the shell will be included in future versions. Most of the implementation was adapted from existing codebases on GitHub.

The aim was to create an implementation that could be used to analyse DKTs on the basis of how the hyperparameters and dataset affect the performance of the network.

Future implementations will examine the performance of DKT on federated learning environments.
