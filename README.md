# Knowledge Tracing
A basic implementation of knowledge tracing for L46 paper.

The implementation is entirely based on the PyTorch framework. The implementation was adapted from existing codebases on DKT. The aim was to create an implementation that could be used to analyse DKTs on the basis of how the hyperparameters and dataset affect the performance of the network.

Script files to allow codebase to run from the shell will be included in future versions. Examining the performance of DKT on federated learning environments will also be considered.


Project Plan
- Read up on existing literature on knowledge tracing and writeup a concise background relating to federated learning.
- Work on deploying at least one of the popular models in knowledge tracing on Flower
- Contrast the performance between the traditional and federated environment
- Write up results and provide insight.

Unfortunately, the goals of the above project were not met. Current implementation only approximated some of the aspects the author wanted to showcase when drafting out the project plan above.
